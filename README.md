This Bomberman game clone utilizes basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to create a classic arcade-style experience.
The game features a modular design, with classes for Bomberman, Enemy, Bomb, and Grid, demonstrating inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
By applying OOP principles, the code achieves reusability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance, making it a solid foundation for future enhancements and expansions.
